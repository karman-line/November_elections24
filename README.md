## November election 2024
This notebook is an analysis of non-presidential races on Long island to see by how much each candidate outran or was outrun by Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. In this we build an ASCII file parser because that was the form the Board of Elections for Suffolk and Nassau Counties provided the data.

**Post analysis:**
Simultaneously, as I analyzed TC's data, I realized it only included Nassau. Only data for parts of assembly districts and congressional seats in Nassau. Suffolk's data was not just in ASCII, it was in PDF format. The files are added here.
